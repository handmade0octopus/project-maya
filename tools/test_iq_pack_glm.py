"""tools/test_iq_pack_glm.py - the packer's glm5-next support, as pure-function tests.

The packer (tools/iq_pack.py) is mostly architecture-agnostic - it works off tensor names and
derives the expert geometry from the tensors - but three things are per-architecture and are what
these tests pin:

  * the architecture check (qwen4exp and glm5-next accepted, everything else refused);
  * the BF16-preserve list.  The two architectures read DIFFERENT projections as high-precision:
    qwen4exp's hyper-connections are hc_*_down/up/inject, glm5-next's mHC is hc_*_fn/base/scale,
    and their indexers share no tensor name.  A list copied from one to the other would preserve
    the wrong tensors - plausible weights, the wrong model;
  * the 3-D flattening.  glm5-next's absorbed-MLA projections (attn_k_b, attn_v_b) and conv
    weights are 3-D; the flat index records two dimensions.  The flatten must be the byte-order
    preserving one (ne0*ne1, ne2) - the engine reads packed tensors by byte offset.

CPU only: no model file, no GPU.
