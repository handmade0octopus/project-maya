"""tools/iq_pack.py - plan v0.3 P6: a native pack for any of the model files (Q2_0, IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS).

    python tools/iq_pack.py --gguf <model>-00001-of-00002.gguf --out pack/iq3_xxs            (standalone)
    python tools/iq_pack.py --gguf <model>-00001-of-00002.gguf --base pack/full --out ...    (share dense.bin)

The i-quant experts cannot be re-expressed in the Q2_0 pack form, so this pack keeps every quantized tensor in
its GGUF form:

  experts.bin          per layer, 512 blobs of [gate rows | up rows | down rows], the raw GGUF slices.  Blob
                       size is per layer (the files mix IQ1_M ... IQ3_S gate/up and Q2_0 / IQ4_NL down).
  native_experts.txt   one line per layer: layer gu_type d_type offset blob_bytes
  index.txt            the table the engine loads.  Quantized dense tensors, token_embd and output are served
                       natively from the GGUF by the engine (--native): their rows carry shape only.
  dense.bin            standalone: the BF16/F16/F32 tensors exactly as the GGUF stores them (index kinds 4/5/2).
                       With --base: the base (Q2_0) pack's dense.bin, hard-linked - the float tensors are
                       byte-identical in all three model files (checked) - plus extra.bin for tensors that are
                       float here but quantized in the base pack (blk.1.ple_key).
  tokenizer/           exported from the GGUF (tools/strata_tokenizer.py), with the model's chat template.

Split files: every shard of the model is read (<name>-0000N-of-0000M.gguf beside --gguf), so the layers may be
split anyhow (Swift 1.5's GGUFs put layers 13-47 in shard 2 and the PLE table in shard 1).  A layer whose experts
are not in shard 1 names its shard in native_experts.txt (v3).  Router tensors stored as F32 whose values are
exactly BF16 (Swift 1.5) are written as BF16, the form the engine's router takes; anything else is refused.

For ordinary quants, --compat-bf16 dequantizes the small projections that the engine reads as BF16, using
round-to-nearest-even. This introduces BF16 rounding; it does not reconstruct the original full-precision
weights. Experts, native attention projections, token embeddings and the disk-backed PLE table stay unchanged.
