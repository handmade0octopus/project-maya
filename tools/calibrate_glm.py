"""Tune the GLM engine's CPU lane for this PC (./maya.sh --calibrate) - Strata's tools/calibrate.py, for GLM-5.3-Flash.

On one or two GPUs most of a token's experts are not in VRAM; the CPU LANE computes the ones in the RAM tier while the
GPU runs the rest.  Two of its settings depend on the PC more than on the model:
  STRATA_GLM_PCIE_SHARE  the share of a route's RAM-tier experts copied over PCIe and run on the GPU instead of on the
                         CPU (0: the CPU takes every one).  A fast PCIe link and a slow CPU want more; an x8 link beside
                         a many-core CPU wants none.  The engine starts with a guess from timing one expert each way.
  STRATA_GLM_CPU_LANE    the CPU threads that compute them.  Every core is not always fastest: the experts are read
                         from RAM, and past the memory's bandwidth more threads only wait (or, on a hybrid CPU, the
                         efficiency cores make the rest wait for them).
Both are measured through ONE running engine - per-request `strata_tune` keys (pcie_frac, cpu_threads) - because an
engine start reads the whole expert set from disk (minutes).  Decode speed only: a prompt balances its CPU and PCIe
shares itself, layer by layer.

A setting is kept only when it beats the engine's own by more than MIN_GAIN in an interleaved re-measurement - the
expert tiers follow the text and the OS adds noise, so single measurements differ by a few percent.

    python tools/calibrate_glm.py maya-<model>.json      # measure and print; ./maya.sh --calibrate also saves it
